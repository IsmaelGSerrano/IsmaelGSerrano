Born in Madrid 🇪🇸, now calling Sweden 🇸🇪 home, my journey has taken a few turns — from atoms to algorithms, from research labs to real-world data.

I started out in physics, drawn to the mysteries of matter and magnetism. After studying at Universidad Complutense and earning my PhD at Zaragoza University, I moved to Sweden for a postdoc at Uppsala University, diving deep into solid-state physics, spintronics, and nanofabrication.

But over time, my curiosity shifted toward something new: data, intelligence, and how we make sense of complex systems with code. That’s when I decided to change paths — I completed a master’s in Big Data & Business Analytics and transitioned into the world of Data Science and AI.

Now I work as a Data Scientist at Signup Software, focusing on AI, MLOps, and Cloud. Python is my everyday companion, and I enjoy building solutions in Azure (with some AWS experience too). I occasionally contribute to the open-source ecosystem — mostly small projects in the LLM space and LangChain documentation.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me behind a camera lens, out hiking in the Swedish woods, playing badminton, or sketching in watercolor. And lately, my favorite role of all: being a new dad to a wonderful baby girl 👶💕

Also: VSCode + Vim forever.
